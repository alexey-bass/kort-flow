# Badmixton Flow — Badminton 2x2 Queue Manager

## Project Overview

Local web app for managing player queue and court assignments during amateur badminton 2x2 sessions. Designed for a coach/admin running sessions with 4-20 players on 1-5 courts.

**Primary device:** 12" tablet placed courtside, also works on phones and desktops.

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML / CSS / JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools, no npm
- PWA with service worker — offline-first, installable on mobile
- `localStorage` for data persistence (survives refresh)
- Firebase Realtime Database v10.12.0 (compat SDK) for optional multi-device sync (CDN script tags)
- Google Analytics (gtag.js)
- Mobile-first responsive CSS with breakpoints at 768px and 1024px
- Preconnect hints for `gstatic.com` and `googletagmanager.com`

## Files

```
index.html                      — App shell, 10 tab panels, modal, toast container
assets/css/styles.css           — All styles, CSS variables, responsive breakpoints
assets/js/app.js                — Application logic (App.Utils through App.Shuffle, App.DnD)
assets/js/i18n.js               — App object init, translations (Polish + English), i18n engine
assets/img/favicon-*.png        — Shuttlecock favicons (16px, 96px, 192px, 512px)
manifest.json                   — PWA manifest (name, icons, theme)
service-worker.js               — Offline-first cache for app shell

ALGO.md                         — Algorithm documentation with scoring weights, examples, quality criteria
test/                           — Node.js tests (node:test runner), mocks in test/helpers.js
scripts/                        — Screenshots (Playwright), simulation, and validation scripts
```

**Load order:** `FIREBASE_CONFIG` (inline in head) → Firebase SDK (CDN, defer) → `assets/js/i18n.js` (defer) → `assets/js/app.js` (defer) → service worker registration

### Service Worker
- Caches app shell (HTML, CSS, JS, icons, manifest) for offline use
- Strategy: stale-while-revalidate (serve from cache, update in background)
- `CACHE_VERSION` in `service-worker.js` is auto-bumped by pre-commit hook when app files change
- External resources (Firebase CDN, Analytics) are network-only — not cached

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in a browser. That's it. No server required.

Or use a local server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Development Workflow

### Before every commit:
```bash
npm run validate   # runs syntax check + tests + simulation quality check + lighthouse
```

### Rules:
- Every new feature or bug fix must have a GitHub issue (create one if not exists), closed when done (use `Fixes #N` in commit message)
- Every new feature must be covered with tests
- README and CLAUDE.md must be updated when adding features
- All tests must pass before committing
- `App.VERSION` and `?v=` cache-busting params are auto-stamped by the pre-commit hook — no manual update needed
- Git hooks live in `hooks/` (tracked). After cloning, run: `git config core.hooksPath hooks`
- Lighthouse scores must stay at 100 across all categories. `npm run validate` runs Lighthouse after tests.
- Shuffle algorithm must pass quality criteria (see ALGO.md). `npm run validate` runs 10 simulations after tests.

### Long Player Names:
- Player names are truncated with CSS `text-overflow: ellipsis` in player list (`.player-name`), board queue (`.bq-name`), board court cards (`.board-team > span`), and admin courts (`.team > span`)
- Truncation is dynamic — based on available pixel width, no character limit

### Performance (CLS prevention):
- All visible-on-load HTML elements must have default content in the HTML to avoid layout shift when JS populates them via `i18n.apply()` or `renderBoard()`
- Tab buttons in `<nav>` must have default Polish text (e.g. `<button data-i18n="tabBoard">Tablica</button>`)
- `#boardCourts` must have placeholder court cards matching the default 4-court layout — JS replaces them via `innerHTML`
- Any new above-the-fold `data-i18n` elements should include default Polish text inline

### Testing:
```bash
npm test           # run all tests
npm run check      # syntax check only
npm run validate   # check + test + simulation quality + lighthouse
```

Tests use Node.js built-in `node:test` runner (no npm dependencies). Test files are in `test/` directory. Browser APIs are mocked in `test/helpers.js`.

### Simulation:
```bash
npm run simulation                                                    # queue mode: 4 courts, 17 players, 2 late, 10 rounds, en
npm run simulation -- --courts 2 --players 10 --late 1 --rounds 5     # custom params
npm run simulation -- --lang pl                                       # Polish report
npm run simulation:shuffle                                            # shuffle mode: 4 courts, 17 players, 2 late, 10 rounds
npm run simulation:shuffle -- --courts 4 --players 17 --rounds 10 --lang pl --output report.html
npm run simulation:validate                                           # run 10 shuffle simulations, check quality criteria
```

Queue simulation generates `simulation-report.html`, shuffle generates `simulation-shuffle-report.html`. Both support `--lang pl|en`. Open in browser and print to PDF.

`simulation:validate` runs 10 shuffle-mode simulations and checks algorithm quality criteria (see ALGO.md): no partner pair repeats, no frequent opponents, no group regrouping, fair games distribution, late player fairness. Included in `npm run validate`.

### Screenshots:
```bash
npm run screenshots   # regenerate all screenshots in screenshots/
```

Uses Playwright (Chromium) to capture each tab at 768×1024 @2x. PNGs are auto-optimized with `pngquant` (lossy, ~70% smaller); skipped gracefully if not installed (`brew install pngquant`). The script (`scripts/screenshots.js`) starts a local server, seeds demo data (12 players, finished matches, active games), and captures:
- `01-board` — Board tab in player mode: 4 courts (2v2, 2v1, 1v1, empty), queue sidebar
- `02-players` — Players tab in admin mode
- `03-results` — Results leaderboard + session highlights in player mode
- `04-queue` — Queue tab in admin mode
- `05-courts` — Courts tab in admin mode
- `06-session` — Session tab in admin mode
- `07-history` — History tab in admin mode
- `08-help` — Help modal overlay

When adding new tabs or modals, add an entry to the `TABS` array in the script. Screenshots are committed to `screenshots/` and referenced in README.

## Architecture

Single global `App` object (created in `assets/js/i18n.js`) with modules:

## Key Concepts

### Edit Player Name
Pencil button (✎) on each player row opens a rename modal with text input and an emoji toggle button (🐾). Tapping an emoji appends it to the name. Rename preserves all player stats, queue position, and history — only the name field changes.

### Renumber Players
"Renumber" button (admin-only, Players tab) renumbers all present players sequentially from #1, preserving their original arrival order. Absent players lose their numbers (reset to 0) and get new ones when marked present again. Confirmation dialog warns about this. Safe to use mid-session — game logic uses player IDs, not numbers.

### Emoji Name Disambiguation
When adding a player whose name already exists (case-insensitive), an emoji picker appears below the input with animal emojis (🐶🐱🐰🦊🐼🐸...). Tapping one adds the player as e.g. "Ola 🐶". A "skip" option allows adding the duplicate name as-is. Hidden when not needed — no distraction for normal flow.

### Session Modes

Two modes, chosen at session creation:

- **Queue mode** (default): Players join a waiting queue, coach suggests/selects players per court, finished players return to queue end. Traditional flow.
- **Shuffle mode**: Coach generates a batch of games upfront via smart algorithm. Games auto-assign to free courts. Sidebar shows upcoming games instead of queue. Schedule tab replaces Queue tab.

Mode stored as `state.mode` ('queue' | 'shuffle'). Schedule stored as `state.schedule[]` with entries: `{ id, teamA, teamB, status, courtId, matchId }`. Status lifecycle: `pending` → `ready` (assigned to court) → `playing` → `finished`.

See [ALGO.md](ALGO.md) for detailed algorithm description with scoring weights and examples.

### Living Queue
Players arrive and get a sequential number (#1, #2, ...). New players (0 games played) are inserted ahead of players who have already played, so latecomers get to play sooner. After a game finishes, all players return to the **end** of the queue. Queue position is the primary factor for next game selection.

### Game Formats
- **2v2** (default) — 4 players, standard doubles
- **2v1** — 3 players, when not enough for 2v2
- **1v1** — 2 players, when not enough for 2v1

The suggestion algorithm picks the best available format based on queue size. Teams of 1-2 players each. Partner history is only tracked for 2-player teams. All formats support score tracking, results, and undo.

### Suggestion Algorithm
Picks players by scoring (queue position, games balance, wishes), diversifies to avoid re-grouping, then splits into teams minimizing partner/opponent repeats. Supports custom tap-to-swap in the suggestion modal. See [ALGO.md](ALGO.md) for full scoring weights and examples.

### Two UI Modes
- **Board** (player-facing): Courts with teams + timer, queue list with games played counter and live wait timer, results. One-tap "Finish" with score input.
- **Management** (admin): Full control — all 10 tabs, add/remove players, manual player selection, settings.

Toggle between modes with the gear icon in the header. Help button (`?`) in header shows quick instructions modal (translated) with app version in the footer.

Header layout (left to right): title + session name, lock indicator (🔒) | language switcher, wake lock (☀), fullscreen (⛶), zoom (1x), help (?), mode toggle (⚙), sync indicator (●).

### Session Name
- Optional custom name set when creating a new session or edited by clicking the name in the header
- Displayed in the header bar after "Badmixton Flow" (e.g. "Badmixton Flow — Thursday training")
- Hidden when empty — header shows just "Badmixton Flow"
- Stored as `state.name`

### Screen Wake Lock
- Toggle button (☀) in header keeps the tablet screen on during sessions
- Uses the Screen Wake Lock API — hidden on browsers that don't support it
- Auto-reacquires the lock when the tab becomes visible again

### UI Zoom
- Zoom selector (1x / 1.25x / 1.5x / 2x) on Session tab for large screens (e.g. Smart TV)
- Uses CSS `zoom` on `body` — scales everything uniformly without CSS rewrites
- Stored per device in `localStorage` (`badminton_zoom`), not synced — each device keeps its own zoom level

### Score Tracking
- Finish confirmation modal with optional score input (e.g. 21:15)
- If score provided: wins/losses and points scored/conceded tracked per player
- Results tab shows leaderboard sorted by wins → win rate → point differential
- Configurable via Session tab: hide Results tab in player mode (`showResults`), limit leaderboard to top 3/5/10 (`resultsLimit`)
- Click any player row to open detailed stats modal: overview, favorite partner, best pair (min 2 games, win rate), most common opponent, head-to-head W/L table

### i18n (Internationalization)
- Two languages: Polish (default) and English
- Static text uses `data-i18n` attributes on HTML elements (also `data-i18n-placeholder`, `data-i18n-title`, `data-i18n-opt`)
- Dynamic text uses `App.t('key')` function calls
- Pluralization via `App.i18n.plural(n, {one, few, many, other})` — handles Polish grammar (1→one, 2-4→few, 5+→many)
- `App.tGames(n)` shortcut for games plural (e.g., "1 gra", "2 gry", "5 gier")
- Language preference saved in `localStorage` (`badminton_lang`)
- UI mode (admin/player) saved in `localStorage` (`badminton_mode`), restored on refresh
- Switcher in header with flag buttons

### Session Lock
- Manual lock/unlock button on Session tab — disables all mutation actions (add/remove players, start/finish games, queue reorder, drag-and-drop)
- Optional auto-lock time picker ("Auto-lock at") — session locks automatically when the specified time is reached
- Optional "Clear queue on lock" checkbox — empties the waiting queue (keeps player list) when session is locked manually or via auto-lock
- When locked: header turns red (#b91c1c), lock icon (🔒) appears in header
- Viewing tabs (Board, Results, History) remain fully functional
- Admin can unlock anytime; non-admin sees red header + lock icon
- Lock state syncs across devices via Firebase
- CSS `body.session-locked` class disables action buttons globally; JS guards provide defense in depth

### Firebase Sync
- Auto-connects to Firebase when creating a new session — no separate "Create session" step
- `App.Sync.autoConnect(sessionId)` polls for Firebase SDK (deferred load) up to 10s, then gives up silently
- Single unified `state.sessionId` used for localStorage, Firebase, and URL (no separate `syncSessionId`)
- Auto-reconnects on page load if `settings.syncEnabled` is true
- Shareable URL with `?session=` parameter for auto-join; share link + copy button shown when connected
- Join: paste session ID into input field, or use the `?session=` URL directly
- Join checks session existence first via `ref.once('value')` — rejects if not found
- `init()` accepts optional callback for async join result
- Config inlined in `index.html` `<head>` (public by design for web apps)
- Falls back to local-only if Firebase SDK not loaded (offline, no network)

### Data Migration
- `App.Storage._ensureState()` validates and fills missing fields on load
- Handles corrupted localStorage, old versions, and Firebase sync data
- Player fields auto-migrated (partnerHistory, wins, losses, points, wishedPartner→wishedPartners, etc.)

## Data Model

Session state stored in `localStorage` as `bs_<sessionId>` (e.g. `bs_bf-x7kQ9m`). Each session gets a unique `sessionId` (auto-generated hash) used for both localStorage and Firebase sync. `bs_last` tracks the most recent key suffix. Index at `bs_index`. URL updates to `?session=<sessionId>` via `history.replaceState`.

```
{
  version: 1,
  sessionId: "bf-x7kQ9m",  // auto-generated unique hash
  date: "2026-03-10",
  name: "",
  mode: "queue",           // "queue" | "shuffle"
  players: { [id]: Player },
  waitingQueue: [playerId, ...],
  courts: { [id]: Court },
  matches: { [id]: Match },
  schedule: [],            // shuffle mode only — ordered list of planned games
  settings: { syncEnabled, locked, autoLockTime, clearQueueOnLock, showResults, resultsLimit },
  nextPlayerNumber: 1,
  isAdmin: true
}
```

**Player:** `{ id, number, name, present, gamesPlayed, lastGameEndTime, queueEntryTime, partnerHistory, opponentHistory, wishedPartners: [id, ...], wishesFulfilled: [id, ...], wins, losses, pointsScored, pointsConceded, totalWaitTime, waitCount }`

**Court:** `{ id, displayNumber, active, occupied, currentMatch, gameStartTime }`

**Match:** `{ id, startTime, endTime, courtId, teamA: [id, ...], teamB: [id, ...], score, status }` — teams have 1-2 players each (supports 1v1, 2v1, 2v2)

**Schedule entry (shuffle mode):** `{ id, teamA: [id, ...], teamB: [id, ...], status, courtId, matchId }` — status: pending → ready → playing → finished
