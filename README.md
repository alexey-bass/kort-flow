## Quick Start

Open `index.html` in a browser. No server, no build tools, no npm required.

For local development:

```bash
npm start
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## How It Works

### Living Queue

Players arrive and get a sequential number (#1, #2, ...). New players who haven't played yet are promoted ahead of those who have, so latecomers get to play sooner. After a game finishes, all 4 players go to the end of the queue. Queue position is the primary factor for who plays next.

### Suggestion Algorithm

Picks the best 4 players by scoring each candidate:
- Queue position (highest priority)
- Games above average penalty (fairness)
- Unfulfilled wish bonus

Then splits them into two teams minimizing:
- Pair repeat penalty
- Opponent repeat penalty
- While maximizing wish fulfillment

Three algorithmic split options are shown, plus a **Custom** option where players can tap to swap teammates between teams or bring in anyone from the queue bench.

### Score Tracking

When finishing a game, a confirmation modal lets you optionally enter the score (e.g. 21:15). If entered, wins/losses and points are tracked per player and shown on the Results leaderboard.

### Two Modes

- **Board mode** (toggle via gear icon) — clean view for players: courts with teams + timer, queue list, results leaderboard
- **Management mode** — full admin control: all tabs, player management, manual selection, settings, sync, debug

### Multi-Device Sync

1. Go to the **Sync** tab
2. Click **Create session** (generates a session ID like `badminton-2026-03-10`). Use the 🎲 button to add a random salt for harder-to-guess IDs
3. Copy the share link and send it to players
4. Anyone opening the link auto-joins the session and sees live updates

Sync uses Firebase Realtime Database. Configuration is inlined in `index.html`.
